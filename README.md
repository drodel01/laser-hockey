# Laser-Hockey

This repository contains the code and report of team "Bellman's Bandits" for the 2025 Reinforcement Learning laser-hockey competition at the University of TÃ¼bingen, based on the laser-hockey environment.

Our team implemented the three algorithms SAC, TD3 and Rainbow, the latter of which won the third price in the final tournament of the course.

# Installation

For installation of the laser-hockey environment and usage examples, see [https://github.com/martius-lab/hockey-env].

The algorithms provided here are implemented independently, hence each folder of this repository contains its own requirements. To install, use

  python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

within the desired algorithm's folder.
